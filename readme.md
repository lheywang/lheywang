I started learning electronics and programming at school, in 2021.
I've always like to understand how things are working, especially when theses are related to a computer...

# Journey :
## Hardware :
**- Schematic and PCB layout on Altium Designer, versions 2016 and 2020-2024 !**
  - Designed an HiFi 32 bits 384 kHz DAC.
  - Designed an USB-C powered Class D 60W audio amplifier based on a TPA3128D2 from Texas Instruments.
  - Designed advanced audio filters.
**-Microelectronics design on Cadence**
  - Designed a single slope ADC
**- VHDL Conception on Intel Quartus Prime**
  - Wrote a basic engine to exploit 

## Programming langages
**- C for low level MCU programmation.**
  - Worked on PWM fan emulator on a PIC 16F1823
  - Worked on a line follower robot at school
**- C++ for embedded linux**
  - Worked on a Wireless Speaker based on Raspberry Pi.
**- PIC Assembly**
  - Acquisition and communication over UART at school
**-Python**
  - Worked on a big automated test bench for PCI / PCIe boards, for a company (ADDI-DATA).
